# Badminton Session Tracker

Allows members to select players they want to play with(rank noted by color) and add them to the waiting list. Waitlist list includes game number, start time, selected players, and the option to delete. The session can be downloaded as a CVS file. Currently, manual reports can be generated such as average wait times, number of games each player played, and more.
